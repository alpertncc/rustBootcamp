<summary>Hello, World!</summary>

### 1.2. Hello, World!

⋅⋅* Compile the codes by using
``` $ rustc main.rs ```

⋅⋅* Run the compiled codes by using 
``` $ ./main ```

⋅⋅* Explaining codes in "main.rs";

``` println! ``` calls a Rust macro. By using ``` ! ```, you are calling a macro instead of normal function.

<summary>Hello, Cargo!</summary>

### 1.3. Hello, Cargo!

⋅⋅* To open a new Cargo project, use;

``` $ cargo new hello_cargo ```
``` $ cd hello_cargo ```

Cargo.toml is the Cargo's configuration file. 

⋅⋅* Open src/main.rs file. There will be a basic **Hello, World!** program generated by cargo. Cargo expects your source files to live inside the "src" directory.

⋅⋅* In hello_cargo directory, compile the codes by using;
``` $ cargo build ```

This creates an executable file in target/debug/hello_cargo

⋅⋅* Run the compiled codes by using 
``` $ ./target/debug/hello_cargo ```

⋅⋅* Instead of using ``` $ cargo build ``` and ``` $ ./target/debug/hello_cargo ```, you can just run this command;
``` $ cargo run ```

⋅⋅* Cargo also provides a command called ``` cargo check ```, which quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but does't produce an executable.
``` $ cargo check ```

⋅⋅* When your project is ready for release, you can use ``` cargo build --release ``` to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in **target/release** instead of **target/debug**
